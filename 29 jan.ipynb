    "2. Python is a versatile and flexible programming language that supports various types of programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, where code is written as a sequence of statements that change a program's state. This paradigm is based on giving instructions to the computer on how to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has extensive support for OOP, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. Python allows you to define classes, create objects, and use them to encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Python also supports functional programming, where functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values. Python has built-in higher-order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), which are commonly used in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting: Python is often used as a scripting language, which means you can write scripts that automate tasks, manipulate data, or interact with systems. Python's concise and readable syntax makes it suitable for quick prototyping and development of small to large-scale scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Development: Python has numerous frameworks, such as Django and Flask, that are widely used for web development. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for building web applications, including support for handling HTTP requests and responses, working with databases, and managing sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science and Machine Learning: Python has become a popular language for data science and machine learning tasks. It has rich libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, that provide powerful tools for data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning model development.\n",
